  title={Can Quantum-Mechanical Description of Physical Reality Be Considered Complete?},
  author={Einstein*†, A. and Podolsky*, B. and Rosen*, N.},
  abstract={In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},

abstract = {Model-based methods lose their performance in confronting with model uncertainties and disturbances. Accordingly, some degrees of adaptation to the involved conditions are required. In this paper, a novel robust adaptive scheme is proposed which guarantees the simultaneous identification and control of a system in the presence of external disturbances. Thereafter, the suggested algorithm is implemented on a 2-DOf spherical parallel robot as a stabilizer device. By identifying unknown parameters of Jacobian matrix, the relative identification error is obtained as 0.0207. Applying external excitations to the base, the ratio of end-effector to base orientation is acquired as 0.091, demonstrating proper stabilization in comparison with other two well-known methods. The proposed structure also reveals a reliable performance in tracking desired paths for the end-effector Euler angles.}
