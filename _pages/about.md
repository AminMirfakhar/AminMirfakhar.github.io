I am a Ph.D. candidate in Computer Science at Tulane University and a co-founder of Rebuildcobot, a startup focused on automation and robotics for the construction industry. My research spans additive manufacturing, optimization, robotics, and automation, with an emphasis on developing autonomous agents and robotic solutions for complex real-world tasks. Currently, under supervision of [Prof. Ramgopal Mettu](https://ramgopalmettu.org/) I'm exploring multi objective, non-planar 3D printing that goes beyond typical layer-based slicing to construct a toolpath. 

Previously, I was an Automation Engineer at [DSDAco.](https://www.dsdaco.com/en/) where i worked for almost 3 years on a number ot projects including ... 

Prior to pursuing my PhD, I graduated with honors from Sharif University of Technology, earning a Master of Science in Mechatronics Engineering and a Bachelor of Science in a Mechanical Engineering.
